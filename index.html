                "I just woke up from the strangest nap where my toaster tried to recruit me for a secret mission involving undercover pastries. 
                It kept insisting that the croissants were plotting something suspicious and that only I could stop the rise of flaky crime. 
                I tried to explain that I was not qualified to negotiate with baked goods, but it just beeped louder like it was scolding me. 
                Then my ceiling fan started spinning in reverse and opened a tiny portal that smelled like strawberries mixed with questionable 
                decisions. A squirrel in a tiny sweater poked its head out and tossed me a sticky note that said, “Do not trust the yogurt.” 
                I still have no idea what that was supposed to mean."
